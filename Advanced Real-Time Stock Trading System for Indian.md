Modern research demonstrates that GPU execution can lead to considerable speedups when compared to CPU counterparts, particularly for tensor-based operations that are fundamental to financial modeling [^2_3].

### LSTM Neural Network Implementation

Long Short-Term Memory networks form the core prediction engine of the system, chosen for their proven superiority in handling time-series financial data. Recent studies demonstrate that LSTM models can achieve remarkable accuracy rates, with some implementations reaching up to 96.41% prediction accuracy for stock price movements [^2_5]. The model architecture incorporates multiple layers with attention mechanisms to capture both short-term market fluctuations and long-term trends [^2_6][^2_7].

Research specifically focused on stock market prediction shows that LSTM models excel in managing nonlinearities and time-series dependencies, thereby enhancing forecast accuracy and reducing investment risks [^2_6]. Studies using eight years of historical data found optimal configurations with specific hyperparameters: 25 epochs, 90:10 training ratios, and 4-year training datasets achieving minimum mean square errors of 0.00146477 [^2_6].

The system implements hybrid architectures combining LSTM with other techniques such as Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), which have shown superior performance with average RMSE values as low as 0.025605 in comparative studies [^2_8]. Advanced implementations also incorporate Exponential Moving Average (EMA) preprocessing to reduce noise and improve prediction accuracy [^2_9].
